## Project Description
Enter your motorcycle route(start/end positions), departure time, and gear waterproof ratings. 
The app fetches weather data along your path, calculates total rain exposure in mm, and tells you if your gear will keep you dry or if you'll arrive soaked.

No more guessing. Just ride or wait.

## Problem Statement
Drivers don't have to guess the weather or nmanually check for their route if there is rain predicted in some portion of the route.
